Manage Multiple Containers
- Requirements:
    - Run a nginx, a mysql, and a httpd(apache) server
    - Run all of them --detact (or -d), name them with --name
    - nginx should listen on 80:80, httpd on 8080:80, mysql on 3306:3306
    - When running mysql, use the --env option (or -e) to pass in MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=yes
    - Use "docker container logs" on mysql to find the random password it created on startup
    - Clean it all up with "docker container stop" and "docker container rm"
    - Use "docker container ls" to ensure everything is correct before and after cleanup
